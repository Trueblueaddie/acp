## Abstract

Developers directly receiving work from others in the company is disruptive and subverts team processes, putting undue stress on the individual (rather than the team).
The following document outlines a process which puts agency back in the hands of the team, and helps prevent poor quality tickets from reaching the sprint backlog.

## Introduction

- Developers are often pinged on Slack for work.
- Puts undue stress on individual.
- Subverts sprint planning/sprint goal/etc.
- Team doesn't get full idea of it's responsibilities.
- Creates unrealistic expectations for others around when work can be completed.
We move at a given pace due to our processes, and the process for accepting work should reflect that pace back to the others.
Reduce "get this done tomorrow" incidents.
- Poor quality tickets.
- Conversation and requirements too often captured in ephemeral Slack.
- Introduce some request for work ticket system that:
    - Allows team members to direct others to the ticket system to submit work.
    - Allows others and team members to go back and forth about requirements (must email others).
    - Gives others detailed information about when a ticket has been accepted, scheduled, completed etc.
    - Integrates with Jira.
